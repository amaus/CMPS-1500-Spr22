    "It is slower to access memory than to execute instructions on the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since every instruction must be fetched from memory, in the von Neumann Architecture, the speed of the computer is bottlenecked by RAM access speed rather than CPU speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is made even worse by the fact that some instructions perform a memory access themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is solved in practice (Havard or Modified Harvard architectures) by using two separate memories, one for program instructions and another for the data of a program. These memories can be accessed at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer fetches the next instruction while executing the current one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other optimizations are the use of caches on the CPU. A cache is a small and very fast memory built directly into the CPU."
